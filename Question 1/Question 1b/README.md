Define 4 classes, Vehicle, Car, Lorry and Bicycle, susch that they statisfy the following requirements.

(i) Car, Lorry and Bicycle are all kind of Vehicle.
(ii) All kinds of Vehicle requrie attributes of owner(a String) and wheels(an integer)
(iii) Car and Lorry require a vehicle registration number(a string). Bicycle does not. Design your classes to minimize the number of field definitions and utilise inheritance.
(iv)Provide accessor and mutator methods for all attributes following the usual naming conventions for such methods(set or get).
(v) BIcycle, CAr and Lorry should be assigned a default number of wheels of 2, 4 and 6 respectively when the classes are instantiated.
(v) Create a test class named VehicleTest and create an instant each of Car, Lorry and Bicycle. Call the accessor methods to display the number of wheels of each object.
